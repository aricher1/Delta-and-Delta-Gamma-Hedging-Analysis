# Delta-and-Delta-Gamma-Hedging-Analysis

This project implements and analyzes dynamic delta and delta-gamma hedging strategies under the Black-Scholes model, simulating from the perspective of a market maker. Using geometric Brownian motion to generate asset price paths, the model tracks mark-to-market PnL for each portfolio component — including the underlying asset, written options, and cash — across thousands of discrete time steps. The analysis evaluates hedging effectiveness under varying levels of volatility, drift, and transaction costs. Key performance metrics include standard deviation, Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional VaR, skewness, and empirical quantile range. The results show that delta-gamma hedging provides significantly tighter convexity control and more stable PnL distributions than delta-only hedging, particularly in high-volatility environments. This project applies core concepts from differential equations, derivatives pricing, and risk management using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
